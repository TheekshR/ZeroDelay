<h2>🧠 Reaction Time Testing & Analytics Platform</h2>

<p>
This project is a <strong>React-based reaction time testing web application</strong> designed to measure human response speed under different conditions and analyze the results using <strong>Power BI</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The application captures <strong>real-time user interaction data</strong> by presenting randomized visual stimuli and calculating reaction time in milliseconds. Before each test, users provide contextual information such as <strong>sleep duration, fatigue level, caffeine intake, and gaming experience</strong>, enabling deeper behavioral analysis beyond raw reaction speed.
</p>

<p>
Collected data is structured for analytics and exported for use in <strong>Power BI dashboards</strong>, allowing insights into how physiological and environmental factors influence reaction time and accuracy.
</p>
